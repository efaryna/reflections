What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-a .git folder is created. So that we can begin to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-the staging area is in the working directory but outside of the repository. It allows you to maintain your work flow

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-run git diff to compare the working directory to the staging area, then remove any files that are outside of one logical change.
